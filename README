Omnicompletions which uses tags database created by "gnat xref -v >tags".

It is a lot simpler then the other omnicompletion plugins which is quite helpfull if you plan to write your own.

NOTE: "gnat xref -v" is very tricky to use as it has almost no diagnostic output - If nothing is printed then usualy the parameters are wrong. Here some important tips:

1) You need to compile your code first and use the "-aO" option to point to your .ali files.
2) "gnat xref -v ../Include/adacl.ads" won't work - use  the "gnat xref -v -aI../Include adacl.ads" instead.
3) "gnat xref -v -aI../Include *.ad?" won't work - use "cd ../Include" and then "gnat xref -v *.ad?"
4) Project manager support is completely broken - don't even try "gnat xref -Padacl.gpr".
5) VIM is faster when the tags file is sorted - use "sort --unique --ignore-case --output=tags tags" .
6) Remember to insert "!_TAG_FILE_SORTED	2	%sort ui" as first line.
